# Beast from the East
A python bot for Rocket League using the framework [RLBot](https://github.com/RLBot/RLBot).

For strategy it uses utility theory (sometimes AI respon curves) which it does pretty well, however, while it excels at positioning and aiming it currently never jumps (so no dodges or aerials).

It will participate in the Rocket League Bot Tournament August 2018.
