# Beast from the East
A python bot for Rocket League using the framework [RLBot](https://github.com/RLBot/RLBot).

For strategy it uses utility theory (also called AI response curves) which it does pretty well. However, while it excels at positioning and aiming it currently never jumps (so no dodges or aerials).

It will participate in the Rocket League Bot Tournament August 2018.

## How to run

1. Make sure you've installed [Python 3.6 64 bit](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.5/python-3.6.5-amd64.exe). During installation:
   - Select "Add Python to PATH"
   - Make sure pip is included in the installation
3. Open Rocket League
4. Double click on run.bat
   - To skip auto-update checks double click on run-quick.bat instead (very first time should always be run.bat)
5. Match has begun!

The match configuration can be change in rlbot.cfg
Rendering can be toggled with PageUp/PageDown.
